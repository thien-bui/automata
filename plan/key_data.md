# Key Data Points Analysis

This document identifies the most useful data points for the route, weather, and discord widgets to help prioritize development and user experience focus.

## Weather Widget

### Primary Data Points
- **Current Temperature**: Temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit (e.g., "22°C / 72°F")
- **Current Condition**: Weather description (e.g., "Clear", "Cloudy", "Rain")
- **Location**: Geographic location for weather data
- **Humidity**: Percentage humidity (e.g., "65%")
- **Wind Speed**: Wind speed in km/h (e.g., "15 km/h")

### Secondary Data Points
- **Hourly Forecast**: Temperature, conditions, and timestamps for upcoming hours
- **Last Updated**: Timestamp of last data refresh
- **Cache Status**: Whether data is from cache or live provider
- **Polling Interval**: Refresh frequency in seconds

### Most Critical for Users
1. **Current temperature and conditions** - Immediate weather status for decision making
2. **Location context** - Ensures relevance of weather data
3. **Hourly forecast** - Essential for planning activities
4. **Data freshness** - Last updated time for reliability assessment

## Route Widget

### Primary Data Points
- **Duration**: Estimated travel time in minutes (e.g., "25.3 min")
- **Distance**: Route distance in kilometers (e.g., "18.5 km")
- **Origin**: Starting address/location
- **Destination**: Ending address/location
- **Monitoring Mode**: Compact vs Navigation mode

### Secondary Data Points
- **Alert Threshold**: Time threshold for alerts (e.g., 30 minutes)
- **Active Alerts**: Route delay notifications
- **Last Updated**: Timestamp of last route calculation
- **Cache Status**: Live vs cached route data
- **Polling Interval**: Refresh frequency

### Most Critical for Users
1. **Travel duration** - Primary decision factor for departure timing
2. **Distance** - Provides context for journey planning
3. **Route endpoints** - Origin and destination for route identification
4. **Alert status** - Critical for delay notifications and alternative planning

## Discord Widget

### Primary Data Points
- **Online Count**: Number of members currently online
- **Total Count**: Total number of guild members
- **Guild Name**: Discord server name
- **Member Status Breakdown**: Count by status (online, idle, dnd, offline)

### Secondary Data Points
- **Member List**: Individual member details including:
  - Display name and username
  - Online status with visual indicators
  - Bot identification
  - Avatar images (if enabled)
- **Last Updated**: Timestamp of last member status refresh
- **Cache Status**: Live vs cached member data
- **Polling Interval**: Refresh frequency

### Most Critical for Users
1. **Online member count** - Quick activity overview for community engagement
2. **Total member count** - Server size context and growth tracking
3. **Status breakdown** - Activity distribution for community health assessment
4. **Individual member status** - Detailed monitoring for specific user availability

## Cross-Widget Common Data Points

All widgets share these operational data points that provide system transparency and user control:

- **Error Status**: Current error messages for troubleshooting
- **Loading State**: Whether data is being refreshed for user feedback
- **Last Updated**: Timestamp of last successful update for data freshness
- **Cache Status**: Live vs cached data indication for reliability
- **Polling Interval**: Automatic refresh frequency for performance tuning
- **Manual Refresh Controls**: User-initiated refresh options for immediate updates

## Data Prioritization Recommendations

### High Priority (Must Have)
- Weather: Current temperature, conditions, location
- Route: Duration, distance, origin/destination
- Discord: Online count, total count, status breakdown

### Medium Priority (Should Have)
- Weather: Humidity, wind speed, hourly forecast
- Route: Alert threshold, active alerts
- Discord: Individual member status, guild name

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
- All widgets: Cache status, polling interval display
- Weather: Extended forecast details
- Route: Historical route data
- Discord: Member avatars, detailed member profiles

## User Experience Considerations

1. **Immediate Value**: Primary data points should be visible at a glance
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Secondary data should be available on demand
3. **Data Freshness**: Users need to know how current the information is
4. **Error Handling**: Clear indication when data is unavailable
5. **Performance**: Critical data should load first, enhanced data can follow

This analysis helps prioritize development efforts and ensures the most valuable information is prominently displayed to users.
